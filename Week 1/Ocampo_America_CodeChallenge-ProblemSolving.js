//A computer application needs to be able to identify if a written paragraph is written in First, Second, or Third Person.
    //1. Using comments, write out 1 strategy that could be used to solve the problem.
    //I will need to create a function that identifies what pronouns have been used in the paragraph and return what category (first, second or third person) they belong to.

    //2. Using comments, create pseudo-code to apply one of the strategies to solve the problem. 
    //I need to define keywords to search for string values in the paragraph including but not limited to "I"/"Me"/Mine/We/Us/..etc...etc...
    //I need to categorize the all they pronouns/keywords ( String values) into 3 arrays: 1st person ["I","We","Us","I'm","We're","Our", "Mine","Mines","Ours"], 2nd person ["You","Yours","Your"], and 3rd person...etc.
    //I need to create for loops using conditionals to print out "First Person", " Second Person", and "Third Person" when a keyword or value is identified.    

    //3. Using comments, write a short paragraph that answers: What is the hardest part of problem-solving? 
    //For this particular problem, I would say the hardest part is having an exhaustive list of pronouns to include in the arrays.

    //For general problem-solving:
    //The hardest part is identifying what the problem is accurately. I believe misinterpretation or incomplete interpretation of the problem can cause more issues than finding the solution.
    //If you create a code or solution that was not asked for, then it can create noise in a system or if it is a person to person communication, it can create other issues.
    //I find myself struggling to make sure I am answering the question that is being asked of me.
    //The most challenging part for me is identifying the big picture because it is easy to get caught up in the details.
